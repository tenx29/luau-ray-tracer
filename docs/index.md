# About Luau Ray Tracer

Luau Ray Tracer is an open-source object-oriented path tracing module for Luau.

!!! info
    Basic understanding of Luau and object-oriented programming is assumed in this documentation.

!!! danger "Performance notice"
    Ray tracing is a very time-consuming process, especially when it's ran on a CPU. Roblox has no way to run shader code on a GPU, so this module is not optimized for performance. Using this module in real-time is not recommended.
