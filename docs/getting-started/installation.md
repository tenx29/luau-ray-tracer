# Installation

Installing Luau Ray Tracer is no different from installing any other Lua module:

1. Insert Luau Ray Tracer to your project and place it to the service of your choice.
2. Require the RayTracingCamera and RayTracer classes to get started.
    ```lua
    local package -- Insert the location of the Luau Ray Tracer package here.
    local RayTracingCamera = require(package.classes.RayTracingCamera)
    local RayTracer = require(package.classes.RayTracer)
    ```
3. You're ready to go! Refer to the API reference and other documentation for more information.
